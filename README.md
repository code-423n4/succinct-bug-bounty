# Welcome to your bounty repo

This file contains information around how to set-up your README.md and prepare for our collaboration.

**Bug Bounties use two repos**:

- a bug bounty repo (this one), which is used for scoping your bug bounty and for providing information to wardens
- a submissions repo, where issues are submitted

Ultimately, when we launch the bug bounty, this repo will be made public and will contain links to the in-scope files to be reviewed and all the information needed for bounty participants.

**Action item for sponsors:**

- [ ] Modify the contents of this README.md file. Describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing.

## Out-of-Scope

### Known Issues

Bug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. Every issue opened in the repo, closed PRs, previous contests and audits are out of scope.

[⚡️**Project:** Please provide any relevant links in a bullet format below:]


### Previous Audits

Any **previously reported** vulnerabilities mentioned in past audit reports are not eligible for a reward.

[⚡️ **Project Name**] previous audits can be found below: [Please insert a link to your previous audits.]


### Specific Types of Issues

**An example of that would be the following:**

- Informational findings.
- Design choices related to protocol. For example, the ability to deploy permissionless pools.
- Issues that are ultimately user errors and can easily be caught in the frontend. For example, transfers to address(0).
- Rounding errors.
- Relatively high gas consumption.

[⚡️**Project:** Please add any specific types of issues that should be considered out-of-scope.]
